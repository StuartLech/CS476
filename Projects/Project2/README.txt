CS476-project 2

Project 2 is to implement the UPGMA clustering algorithm on distance matrix inputs to construct phylogenetic trees in Newick format & 
the Neighbor Joining algorithm on distance matrix inputs inputs to constructphylogenetic trees in Newick format with branch distances shown.

The source code was completed in Python.
To use the program, load source code file into terminal ensuring it is in the same directory as your input text files or folders. Once the code is ran, a simple prompy will appear letting you know the proper options to either choose which file and which algorithm you would like to test with. Once complete, depending on which algorithm, console outputs should consist of proper UPGMA or Neighbour output in Newick format.
